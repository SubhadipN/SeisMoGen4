# BIdirectional SEISmic MOtion GENarator (BiSeisMoGen)

## Description
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/eqe.3537">Naskar and Das (2021)</a> introduced a new stochastic simulation methodology to generate bidirectional ground motions taking into account the frequency-dependent correlation structure of the underlying ground motion process. A Priestley process-based framework was adopted to address the nonstationarities in amplitudes and frequencies. The ***biseismogen.exe***, a Fortran-based computer program, is provided in this repository to generate $n\in[50,100]$ numbers of simulated bidirectional ground motion samples from the recorded data of a particular ground motion process following the methodology proposed by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/eqe.3537">Naskar and Das</a>.
